# UFOs

## Overview of Analysis

The overall goal of this project is to present information related to UFO sightings including the location, date, shape and duration. 

## Results

The UFO sightings can be searched and viewed in a table format based on filters provided by the user. The user can input inforamtion regarding data, city, state, country, shape and the webpage will generate a table meeting those criteria. 

## Summary
One drawback is that the data can only be selcted based on the currently available filters. There is no option to search through the comments. The user has to type the text for each input parameter e.g. type the exact date, shape, name of city etc. 

Recommendations for further development: 
1) Graphs to summarize and better visualize the data
2) Provide option for users to select from a drop down menu rather than input text
